# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

## Overview
This repository contains various machine learning algorithms implemented in Python. Each algorithm has its own directory with sample code to demonstrate its functionality. The algorithms included are designed to help users understand the concepts and implementations of machine learning techniques.

## Algorithms Included
- **Gradient Descent**: An optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function.
- **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised learning algorithm for partitioning a dataset into clusters.
- **Linear Regression using Scikit-Learn**: A simple implementation of linear regression to predict continuous values.
- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for predicting binary classes.

## Directory 
-each folder containn a code and related dataset

## Future Enhancements
- Add more machine learning algorithms and techniques.
- Include Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration.
- Provide additional datasets for testing the algorithms.
