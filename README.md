codes &amp; algorithms on machine learning
simple gradient descent algorithm applied on fake data in (housing.txt) file and log file (gradlog.txt) is created to store updates made cost function 
in every loop we can see that cost is reducing in every loop of 1000 we can update the loop to change epoch conditinn of 1000 and put
threshold value of cost function for terminating the loop
